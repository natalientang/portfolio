      "description": "I'm a software engineer based in the DFW area. I have always been drawn to technology and innovation, and after graduating from the University of North Texas in the spring of 2022, I took the leap and transitioned from the healthcare industry to start my tech journey that summer. As a detail-oriented person, I have a passion for designing, developing, and maintaining websites and mobile applications and ensure that every aspect I bring is top-notch and user-friendly. I love that software engineering offers me endless opportunities and progression and gives me the chance to make a positive impact on people's lives and communities, all while allowing me to continue to grow as an individual.",
