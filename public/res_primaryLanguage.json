I have always been drawn to technology and innovation, and after graduating from the University of North Texas in the spring of 2022, I took the leap and transitioned from the healthcare industry to start my tech journey that summer. As a detail-oriented person, I have a passion for designing, developing, and maintaining websites and mobile applications and ensure that every aspect I bring is top-notch and user-friendly. In my free time, I love to hang out with friends/family, try new foods, travel, journal, and play video games! I also love everything Studio Ghibli :)",
